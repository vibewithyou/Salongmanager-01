## üîß Environment Configuration Required

### Required .env Variables
```bash
# Security
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=salongmanager.app,localhost,127.0.0.1
SESSION_DOMAIN=.salongmanager.app

# Webhooks
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_stripe_webhook_secret

# Queue
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### Database Setup Required
```bash
# Create queue tables
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

## üì± Flutter PWA Readiness

### PWA Configuration
- [x] Manifest.json updated with proper icons
- [x] Theme colors configured (#FFD700)
- [x] Background color set (#000000)
- [x] Icons directory structure created
- [ ] Icon files need to be generated (see icons/README.md)

### Flutter Analysis
- [ ] Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- [ ] Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies
- [ ] Test PWA functionality in browser

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Pre-deployment
```bash
# 1. Run audit script
bash ops/audit/audit.sh

# 2. Set up queue tables
cd salonmanager/backend
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate

# 3. Cache configuration
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

# 4. Start queue worker
php artisan queue:work --tries=3 --backoff=10
```

### Flutter Build
```bash
cd salonmanager/frontend
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter build web --release
```

## üîç Security Audit Results

### TODO/FIXME Items Found
- 140 TODO/FIXME items identified in codebase
- Most are development placeholders and feature stubs
- Critical security items have been addressed

### Orphaned Laravel Files
- Found Laravel app/ and database/ directories outside salonmanager/backend
- These appear to be legacy or duplicate structures
- Consider cleanup for production deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Considerations

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- Adjust rate limits based on expected traffic
- Monitor and tune limits after deployment
- Consider different limits for different environments

### Logging & Monitoring
- PII redaction is active in logs
- Consider log aggregation service for production
- Set up monitoring for failed queue jobs

### Queue Management
- Set up supervisor or similar for queue workers
- Monitor queue health and failed jobs
- Consider queue scaling based on load

### SSL/TLS
- Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
- HSTS headers will enforce HTTPS
- Consider certificate management strategy

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Generate PWA Icons**: Create actual icon files for the PWA
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure production .env with actual values
3. **Database Migration**: Run migrations and set up queue tables
4. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests before deployment
5. **Monitoring**: Set up production monitoring and alerting
6. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation with new security features
