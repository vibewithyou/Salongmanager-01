  - `invoices`, `bookings`, `roles`, `permissions`, `booking_services`
  - `booking_media`, `gallery_photos`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Foreign Key Constraints**: Need to be added after migration

#### 2. Security Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Throttle Middleware**: Rate limiting not fully implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Configuration**: `.env.example` needs to be copied to backend

#### 3. Testing & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unit Tests**: Only feature tests present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **E2E Tests**: Need comprehensive end-to-end testing

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps (30 minutes)

### 1. Execute Database Migration
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp ops/audit/env.example salonmanager/backend/.env

# Run the migration
cd salonmanager/backend
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Test the Application
```bash
# Start the Docker stack
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Test the API
curl http://localhost/api/health
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Edit `salonmanager/backend/.env` with your production values:
- Database credentials
- Redis configuration
- Payment gateway keys
- Email settings
