# Booking System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive booking system with real-time availability checking, RBAC authorization, conflict resolution, media attachments, and cancellation policies.

## Backend Implementation (Laravel 12)

### 1. Database Changes
- **Migration**: `2025_01_04_001200_alter_bookings_add_fields.php`
  - Added buffer times (before/after)
  - Added notes field
  - Added service_id and duration fields
  - Created booking_media pivot table for attachments

### 2. Core Services
- **AvailabilityService** (`app/Services/Booking/AvailabilityService.php`)
  - Checks opening hours compatibility
  - Validates against stylist absences
  - Detects booking conflicts including buffer zones
  - Provides alternative time slot suggestions

### 3. Request Validation
- **StoreBookingRequest**: Validates booking creation with all fields
- **UpdateStatusRequest**: Validates status updates (confirm/decline/cancel)

### 4. RBAC Authorization
- **BookingPolicy** updated with:
  - `modify()`: Stylists can modify own bookings, owners/managers any
  - `cancel()`: Customers can cancel own, stylists/owners/managers assigned
  - Registered in AuthServiceProvider

### 5. Controller Updates
- **BookingController** enhanced with:
  - `store()`: Creates bookings with availability check and conflict suggestions
  - `updateStatus()`: Unified method for confirm/decline/cancel with RBAC
  - `attachMedia()`: Attach media files to bookings
  - Backward compatibility maintained for legacy endpoints

### 6. Events & Notifications
- Created event classes:
  - `Booking\Created`
  - `Booking\Confirmed`
  - `Booking\Declined`
  - `Booking\Canceled`
- Events trigger existing notification listeners

### 7. API Routes
Added new versioned endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/bookings` - Create with availability check
- `POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/status` - Update status
- `POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/media` - Attach media

### 8. Testing
- Comprehensive feature tests for:
  - Overlapping booking detection
  - Opening hours validation
  - Absence conflict checking
  - Buffer time calculations

## Frontend Implementation (Flutter)

### BookingRepository Updates
- **createBooking()**: Enhanced with conflict handling and suggestions
- **updateStatus()**: Unified status update method
- **attachMedia()**: Media attachment support
- **cancelBooking()**: Returns cancellation fee information

### Conflict Resolution UX
- Returns 409 with suggestions on conflict
- Frontend can display alternative time slots
- Automatic retry with selected alternative

## Cancellation Policy
- Free cancellation: >24 hours before appointment
- 20% fee: <24 hours before appointment
- Fee rate returned in API response

## API Documentation
Complete API documentation in `docs/api/BOOKING.md` including:
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response examples
- Availability logic explanation
- Status workflow
- Error codes
