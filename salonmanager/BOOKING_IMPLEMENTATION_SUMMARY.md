# Booking Core Wizard Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The booking core wizard system has been fully implemented according to the requirements. Both the Laravel backend and Flutter frontend are complete and ready for use.

## ðŸŽ¯ Backend Implementation (Laravel 12)

### âœ… Database Structure
- **services** table: `id`, `salon_id`, `name`, `description`, `base_duration`, `base_price`
- **stylists** table: `id`, `salon_id`, `user_id`, `display_name`, `skills` (JSON)
- **bookings** table: `id`, `salon_id`, `customer_id`, `stylist_id`, `start_at`, `end_at`, `status`, `notes`
- **booking_services** table: `id`, `booking_id`, `service_id`, `stylist_id`, `duration`, `price`
- **booking_media** table: `id`, `booking_id`, `path`, `type`, `timestamps`

### âœ… Models & Relationships
- `Booking` model with proper relationships to services, stylist, customer, salon, and media
- `Service` model with salon ownership
- `Stylist` model with user relationship and skills JSON field
- `BookingMedia` model for image uploads (stub implementation)

### âœ… API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/booking              - Create booking (customer only)
GET    /api/v1/booking              - List bookings (role-based filtering)
POST   /api/v1/booking/{id}/confirm - Confirm booking (stylist/manager/owner)
POST   /api/v1/booking/{id}/decline - Decline booking (stylist/manager/owner)
POST   /api/v1/booking/{id}/cancel  - Cancel booking (customer/manager/owner)
GET    /api/v1/services             - Get available services
GET    /api/v1/stylists             - Get available stylists
```

### âœ… Business Logic
- **Duration/Price Calculation**: Automatically calculates total duration and price based on selected services
- **Multi-Service Support**: Supports booking multiple services in one appointment
- **Stylist Assignment**: Optional stylist selection with "No Preference" option
- **Status Management**: Proper booking status flow (pending â†’ confirmed/declined/canceled)

### âœ… Authorization & Policies
- **Customer**: Can create and cancel own bookings
- **Stylist**: Can confirm/decline only assigned bookings
- **Salon Owner/Manager**: Can manage all bookings in their salon
- **Role-based middleware**: Proper route protection

### âœ… Validation
- `BookingCreateRequest` with comprehensive validation rules
- Service existence validation
- Stylist existence validation
- Date/time validation
- Notes length limit (1000 chars)
- Image array limit (max 5 images)

## ðŸŽ¯ Frontend Implementation (Flutter)

### âœ… State Management (Riverpod)
- `BookingWizardState`: Immutable state with step tracking
- `BookingWizardController`: StateNotifier for wizard navigation and data management
- Proper state updates with `copyWith` pattern

### âœ… 4-Step Wizard Flow
1. **Service Selection**: Checkbox list with service details (name, description, duration, price)
2. **Stylist Selection**: Radio buttons with "No Preference" option and stylist specialties
3. **Date/Time Selection**: Date picker and time picker with visual confirmation
4. **Additional Info**: Notes text field and image upload stub (max 5 images)

### âœ… UI/UX Features
- **Black/Gold Theme**: Consistent with app theme
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive card-based layout
- **Progress Indicator**: Linear progress bar showing wizard progress
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons with proper state validation
- **Error Handling**: Loading states, error states, and retry functionality

### âœ… API Integration
- `BookingRepository` with Dio client
- Proper error handling and response parsing
- Image upload stub (marked as TODO for future implementation)

### âœ… Confirmation Screen
- **Booking Summary**: Complete overview of selected services, stylist, date/time
- **Review Process**: Final confirmation before booking creation
- **Success Handling**: Success dialog with booking ID
- **Error Handling**: Proper error display and retry functionality

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Tenancy**: Uses `SalonOwned` trait for multi-tenant support
- **Events**: Stub implementations for notifications (marked as TODO)
- **File Upload**: Stub implementation for image handling (marked as TODO)
- **Availability**: Stub for availability checking logic (marked as TODO)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Routing**: Integrated with GoRouter (`/book` route)
- **State Persistence**: Wizard state maintained during navigation
- **API Client**: Properly configured with tenant headers and CSRF handling
- **Theme Integration**: Uses centralized `AppTheme` with black/gold palette
