# Customer Profile, Notes/Images, Loyalty & Discounts Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive customer management system for the SalonManager application, including customer profiles, notes, media management, loyalty programs, and discount systems.

## Backend Implementation (Laravel 12)

### Database Migrations
- ✅ `customer_profiles` - Customer profile data with preferences and address
- ✅ `customer_notes` - Staff notes for customers with author tracking
- ✅ `customer_media` - Media storage (TODO: actual file upload implementation)
- ✅ `loyalty_cards` - Customer loyalty points and metadata
- ✅ `loyalty_transactions` - Point earning/redeeming history
- ✅ `discounts` - Discount codes and promotion management

### Models
- ✅ `CustomerProfile` - Customer profile with SalonOwned trait
- ✅ `CustomerNote` - Staff notes with author relationships
- ✅ `CustomerMedia` - Media storage (placeholder for future implementation)
- ✅ `LoyaltyCard` - Loyalty points and tier management
- ✅ `LoyaltyTransaction` - Point transaction history
- ✅ `Discount` - Discount code management

### API Controllers
- ✅ `CustomerController` - Customer CRUD operations with RBAC
- ✅ `NoteController` - Customer notes management
- ✅ `LoyaltyController` - Loyalty points and transactions
- ✅ `DiscountController` - Public discount listing

### Request Validation
- ✅ `ProfileUpsertRequest` - Customer profile validation
- ✅ `NoteRequest` - Note creation validation

### RBAC Policies

- ✅ `LoyaltyPolicy` - Loyalty system access control

### API Routes
- ✅ `/api/v1/customers` - Customer directory with search and pagination
- ✅ `/api/v1/customers/{customer}` - Customer details and profile
- ✅ `/api/v1/customers/{customer}/notes` - Customer notes
- ✅ `/api/v1/customers/{customer}/loyalty` - Loyalty card and transactions
- ✅ `/api/v1/discounts` - Public discount listing
- ✅ GDPR endpoints for export and deletion requests (stubs)

## Frontend Implementation (Flutter)

### Models
- ✅ `Customer` - Basic customer information
- ✅ `CustomerProfile` - Customer profile with preferences
- ✅ `CustomerNote` - Staff notes with timestamps
- ✅ `LoyaltyCard` - Loyalty points and metadata
- ✅ `LoyaltyTx` - Transaction history

### Repository Pattern
- ✅ `CustomerRepository` - API communication layer
- ✅ Methods for all customer operations (list, detail, notes, loyalty)

### State Management (Riverpod)
- ✅ `CustomerListController` - Customer list with search and pagination
- ✅ `CustomerDetailController` - Customer detail with tabs management

### UI Components
- ✅ `CustomerListPage` - Searchable customer list with infinite scroll
- ✅ `CustomerDetailPage` - Tabbed interface with:
  - Profile tab (contact info, preferences)
  - Notes tab (add/view notes, TODO: image gallery)
  - Loyalty tab (points display, manual adjustments)

### Routing
- ✅ `/customers` - Customer list page
- ✅ `/customers/:id` - Customer detail page with tabs

## Key Features

### Customer Management
- Searchable customer directory
- Detailed customer profiles with preferences
- Staff notes with author tracking
- GDPR compliance stubs (export/deletion requests)

### Loyalty System
- Point earning and redemption
- Transaction history tracking
- Manual point adjustments by staff
- Tier-based benefits (configurable)

### Discount System
- Public discount code listing
- Flexible discount types (percentage/fixed)
- Condition-based discounts (minimum amount, customer tier, etc.)
- Validity period management

### RBAC Integration
- Role-based access control for all operations
- Stylists can only edit their own notes
- Customers can only view their own data
- Managers and owners have full access

## TODO Items

### Backend
- [ ] Implement actual file upload for customer media
- [ ] Create GDPR export/deletion job queues
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement discount code generation and management

### Frontend
- [ ] Add image gallery for customer media
- [ ] Implement profile editing forms
- [ ] Add discount code application
- [ ] Create customer creation/registration flow

### Integration
- [ ] Connect loyalty system to booking completion
- [ ] Integrate discount system with POS
- [ ] Add real-time notifications for point changes
- [ ] Implement customer communication features

## API Documentation

- ✅ `CUSTOMERS.md` - Complete customer API documentation
- ✅ `LOYALTY.md` - Loyalty system documentation with business rules
- ✅ `DISCOUNTS.md` - Discount system documentation with examples

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints protected with proper RBAC
- Customer data access restricted by role
- GDPR compliance stubs in place
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Audit logging ready for implementation

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination implemented for customer lists
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading for customer detail tabs
- Optimized API responses with minimal data transfer

This implementation provides a solid foundation for customer management in the salon system while maintaining security, scalability, and user experience best practices.
