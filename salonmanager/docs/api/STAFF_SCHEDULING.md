## Status Values

### Shift Status
- `planned`: Newly created shift, not yet confirmed
- `confirmed`: Shift confirmed by stylist
- `swapped`: Shift has been swapped with another stylist
- `canceled`: Shift has been canceled

### Absence Status
- `requested`: Initial status when created by stylist
- `approved`: Approved by manager/owner
- `rejected`: Rejected by manager/owner

### Absence Types
- `vacation`: Vacation time
- `sick`: Sick leave
- `other`: Other reasons

## Role-Based Access Control

### Salon Owner/Manager
- Can view, create, update, and delete all shifts and absences
- Can approve/reject absence requests
- Can move and resize any shift

### Stylist
- Can view all shifts and absences
- Can create absence requests
- Can update own absence requests (only when status is 'requested')
- Can update own shifts (confirm/cancel planned shifts)
- Can move and resize own shifts

## Calendar Feed Integration

The shifts endpoint supports calendar feed queries with `from` and `to` parameters for efficient date range filtering. This enables calendar views to load only relevant data for the displayed time period.

## Drag & Drop Semantics

- **Move**: Changes both start and end times while preserving duration
- **Resize**: Changes only the end time, effectively changing duration

Both operations include validation to ensure:
- End time is after start time
- No overlapping shifts for the same stylist (TODO: collision detection with bookings)
